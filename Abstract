The stopwatch is basically a timepiece that is designed particularly to measure the time elapsed
between the activation and deactivation of the stopwatch. The users can
start the Stopwatch and stop it anytime. It was originally invented by Samuel Watson.
There is also a button to restart the stopwatch that will set the stopwatch to starting.
So our task is to make an application for Stopwatch which can be used whenever
required.
A stopwatch is a simple app that is used to record or measure time. It has mainly 5
main functions: Start, Stop, Pause ,Reset and lap. The stopwatch function is also
present as an additional function of many electronic devices such as wristwatches, cell
phones, portable music players, and computers.
In manual timing, the clock is started and stopped by a person pressing a button.
In fully automatic time, both starting and stopping are triggered automatically, by
sensors. The timing functions are traditionally controlled by two buttons on the case.
Pressing the top button starts the timer running, and pressing the button a second time
stops it, leaving the elapsed time displayed. A press of the second button then resets
the stopwatch to zero. The second button is also used to record split times or lap
times. When the split time button is pressed while the watch is running it allows the
elapsed time to that point to be read, but the watch mechanism continues running to
record total elapsed time. Pressing the split button a second time allows the watch to
resume display of total time.
